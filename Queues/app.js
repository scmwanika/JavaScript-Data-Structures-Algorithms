/* A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the
front. Queues are used to store data in the order in which they occur, as opposed to a
stack, in which the last piece of data entered is the first element used for processing.
Think of a queue like the line at your bank, where the first person into the line is the
first person served, and as more customers enter a line, they wait in the back until it is
their turn to be served.
A queue is an example of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. Queues are used to
order processes submitted to an operating system or a console.log spooler, and simulation
applications use queues to model scenarios such as customers standing in the line at a
bank or a grocery store.

Queue Operations
The two primary operations involving queues are inserting a new element into a queue
and removing an element from a queue. The insertion operation is called enqueue, and
the removal operation is called dequeue. The enqueue operation inserts a new element
at the end of a queue, and the dequeue operation removes an element from the front of
a queue. Figure 5-1 illustrates these operations.

Another important queue operation is viewing the element at the front of a queue. This
operation is called peek. The peek operation returns the element stored at the front of
a queue without removing it from the queue. Besides examining the front element, we
also need to know how many elements are stored in a queue, which we can satisfy with
the length property; and we need to be able to remove all the elements from a queue,
which is performed with the clear operation.
An Array-Based Queue Class Implementation
Implementing the Queue class using an array is straightforward. Using JavaScript arrays
is an advantage many other programming languages donâ€™t have because JavaScript contains
a function for easily adding data to the end of an array, push(), and a function for
easily removing data from the front of an array, shift().
The push() function places its argument at the first open position of an array, which
will always be the back of the array, even when there are no other elements in the array.
Here is an example: */
names = [];
names.push("Cynthia");
names.push("Jennifer");
console.log(names); // displays Cynthia,Jennifer
// Then we can remove the element from the front of the array using shift():
names.shift();
console.log(names); // displays Jennifer

// The complete Queue class definition along with a test program.
function Queue() {
  this.dataStore = [];
  this.enqueue = enqueue;
  this.dequeue = dequeue;
  this.front = front;
  this.back = back;
  this.toString = toString;
  this.empty = empty;
}
function enqueue(element) {
  this.dataStore.push(element);
}
function dequeue() {
  return this.dataStore.shift();
}
function front() {
  return this.dataStore[0];
}
function back() {
  return this.dataStore[this.dataStore.length - 1];
}
function toString() {
  var retStr = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < this.dataStore.length; ++i) {
    retStr += this.dataStore[i] + "\n";
  }
  return retStr;
}
function empty() {
  if (this.dataStore.length == 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
// test program
var q = new Queue();
q.enqueue("Meredith");
q.enqueue("Cynthia");
q.enqueue("Jennifer");
console.log(q.toString());
q.dequeue();
console.log(q.toString());
console.log("Front of queue: " + q.front());
console.log("Back of queue: " + q.back());

/* The output is:
Meredith
Cynthia
Jennifer
Cynthia
Jennifer
Front of queue: Cynthia
Back of queue: Jennifer 

Using the Queue Class: Assigning Partners at a Square Dance
As we mentioned earlier, queues are often used to simulate situations when people have
to wait in line. Once scenario we can simulate with a queue is a square dance for singles.
When men and women arrive at this square dance, they enter the dance hall and stand
in the line for their gender. As room becomes available on the dance floor, dance partners
are chosen by taking the first man and woman in line. The next man and woman move
to the front of their respective lines. As dance partners move onto the dance floor, their
names are announced. If a couple leaves the floor and there is not both a man and a
woman at the front of each line, this fact is announced.
This simulation will store the names of the men and women participating in the square
dance in a text file. Here is the file we will use for the simulation:
F Allison McMillan
M Frank Opitz
M Mason McMillan
M Clayton Ruff
F Cheryl Ferenback
M Raymond Williams
F Jennifer Ingram
M Bryan Frazer
M David Durr
M Danny Martin
F Aurora Adney
Each dancer is stored in a Dancer object: */

/* Sorting Data with Queues
Queues are not only useful for simulations; they can also be used to sort data. Back in
the old days of computing, programs were entered into a mainframe program via punch
cards, with each card holding a single program statement. The cards were sorted using
a mechanical sorter that utilized bin-like structures to hold the cards. We can simulate
this process by using a set of queues. This sorting technique is called a radix sort (see
Data Structures with C++ [Prentice Hall]). It is not the fastest of sorting algorithms,
but it does demonstrate an interesting use of queues.
The radix sort works by making two passes over a data set, in this case the set of integers
from 0 to 99. The first pass sorts the numbers based on the 1s digit, and the second pass
sorts the numbers based on the 10s digit. Each number is placed in a bin based on the
digit in each of these two places. Given these numbers: 91, 46, 85, 15, 92, 35, 31, 22

function for displaying the contents of an array. */
function distribute(nums, queues, n, digit) {
  for (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (digit == 1) {
      queues[nums[i] % 10].enqueue(nums[i]);
    } else {

/* Priority Queues
In the course of normal queue operations, when an element is removed from a queue,
that element is always the first element that was inserted into the queue. There are certain
applications of queues, however, that require that elements be removed in an order other
than first-in, first-out. When we need to simulate such an application, we need to create
a data structure called a priority queue.
A priority queue is one where elements are removed from the queue based on a priority
constraint. For example, the waiting room at a hospitalâ€™s emergency department (ED)
operates using a priority queue. When a patient enters the ED, he or she is seen by a
triage nurse. This nurseâ€™s job is to assess the severity of the patientâ€™s condition and assign
the patient a priorty code. Patients with a high priority code are seen before patients
with a lower priority code, and patients that have the same priority code are seen on a
first-come, first-served, or first-in, first-out, basis.
Letâ€™s begin building a priority queue system by first defining an object that will store the
elements of the queue: */
function Patient(name, code) {
  this.name = name;
  this.code = code;
}
/* The value for code will be an integer that represents the patientâ€™s priority, or severity.
Now we need to redefine the dequeue() function that removes the element in the queue
with the highest priority. We will define the highest priority element as being the element
with the lowest priority code. This new dequeue() function will move through the
queueâ€™s underlying array and find the element with the lowest code. Then the function
uses the splice() function to remove the highest-priority element. Here is the new
definition for dequeue() */

function dequeue() {
  var priority = this.dataStore[0].code;
  for (var i = 1; i < this.dataStore.length; ++i) {
    if (this.dataStore[i].code < priority) {
      priority = i;
    }
  }
  return this.dataStore.splice(priority, 1);
}
/* The dequeue() function uses a simple sequential search to find the element with the
highest priority code (the lowest number; 1 has a higher priority than 5). The function
returns an array of one elementâ€”the one removed from the queue.
Finally, we add a toString() function modified to handle Patient objects: */
function toString() {
  var retStr = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < this.dataStore.length; ++i) {
    retStr +=
      this.dataStore[i].name + " code: " + this.dataStore[i].code + "\n";
  }
  return retStr;
}
// demonstrates how the priority queue system works.
// A priority queue implementation
var p = new Patient("Smith", 5);
var ed = new Queue();
ed.enqueue(p);
p = new Patient("Jones", 4);
ed.enqueue(p);
p = new Patient("Fehrenbach", 6);
ed.enqueue(p);
p = new Patient("Brown", 1);
ed.enqueue(p);
p = new Patient("Ingram", 1);
